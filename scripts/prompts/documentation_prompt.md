No actual code will be included in the documentation.

Instructions for Submission:

Paste the entire .java class file below, including all comments, fields, constructor(s), and method signatures.

    // The player's current gold amount
    private int gold;
    
    // Constructor for PlayerInventory
    public PlayerInventory(String playerId, int initialGold) {
        this.playerId = playerId;
        this.gold = initialGold;
    }
    
    // Adds gold to the player's inventory
    public void addGold(int amount) {
        // Implementation not included in documentation
